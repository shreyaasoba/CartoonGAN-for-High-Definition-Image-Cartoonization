# CartoonGAN-for-High-Definition-Image-Cartoonization
Implemented a novel approach for transforming high-definition real-world images into high-quality cartoon images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project focused on three key representations: Surface, Structure, and Texture, to capture the essence of cartoon artistry.

**Features:**
Efficient execution and real-time processing
Quality enhancement and comparative performance
Hardware optimization and scalability
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy

**Results**
Achieved real-time cartoonization on GPU devices, with an impressive execution time of 18.22 ms for high-quality (HQ) images.
Thorough comparison with four different algorithms, showcasing superior performance in terms of both execution time and image quality.
