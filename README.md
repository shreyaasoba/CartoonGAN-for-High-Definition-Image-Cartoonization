# CartoonGAN-for-High-Definition-Image-Cartoonization
Implemented a novel approach for transforming high-definition real-world images into high-quality cartoon images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project focused on three key representations: Surface, Structure, and Texture, to capture the essence of cartoon artistry.
